After analyzing the data, the top 3 states that had the highest number of fraud, identity theft and/or other reports per 100,000 population were Nevada, Florida, and Delaware.  In terms of total dollar losses, California incurred over $187M in 2019, Texas incurred approximately $101M and Florida incurred approximately $90M.  Across all 50 states and the District of Columbia as well as Puerto Rico, the grand total of dollar losses amounts to $1.2B.  It appears that the overall trend of fraud reports have been increasing from 2001 to 2019, which has peaked to over 3.2 million in 2019.
